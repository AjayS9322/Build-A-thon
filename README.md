In the dataset it contains the details about the customer name and the review provided to the employee. It will contain the Positive and negative reviews also. 
With the help of this dataset we are going to giving score to the employee. So it would appreciate the employee who work well in the job which lead to the next level. And in  the other case those who got the low score they have to put more effort and we have to give some training to that employee. Definitely he can able to do that with this positive approche which leads to the success.
